# About

**HiveNAS** is a feature-rich, Neural Architecture Search *(NAS)* framework based on [Artificial Bee Colony optimization](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-72950-1_77).

## Abstract

The traditional Neural Network-development process requires substantial expert knowledge and relies heavily on intuition and trial-and-error. NAS frameworks were introduced to robustly search for network topologies, as well as facilitate the automated development of Neural Networks. While some optimization approaches – such as Genetic Algorithms – have been extensively explored in the NAS context, other Metaheuristic Optimization algorithms have not yet been evaluated. This framework introduces the first Artificial Bee Colony-based NAS framework -- **HiveNAS** -- which performs competitively relative to the state-of-the-art.
